Passionate about Data and Data Storytelling.

### More Information

I believe that there is always room for improvement and that there is always an answer if you look hard enough. For me, those answers are hidden in data and I love exploring it and finding interesting insights. It is fascinating to me, how the results of the analysis might end up being something completely different from original expectations and how the findings might steer the research in a different direction. The quote below summarizes my beliefs really well:
“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.” - Ronald H. Coase
I am passionate about data analysis and enjoy visualizing and telling the story with data.
